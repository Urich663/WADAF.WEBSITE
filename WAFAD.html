    <h2 class="section-title">BACKGROUND</h2>
    <div class="content-block">
        <p>WAFAD GROUP is a fast-rising, fully integrated agribusiness enterprise that is redefining poultry production and agricultural development across Ghana and West Africa. Established in 2009, WAFAD was born from a bold vision to transform agriculture through innovation, inclusivity, and grassroots empowerment.</p>
        
        <p>The company’s journey began in the most modest of settings, strategic planning from a single room, operations carried in a backpack office, and production launched on a rented, abandoned farm. In its early years, the founding team often walked long distances to engage clients and stakeholders, navigating limited resources and widespread skepticism. Many dealers and distributors dismissed the company’s efforts, perceiving a lack of means as a lack of potential. But beneath the surface was a powerful force: a mission-driven team determined to build a transformative agribusiness that put farmers at the center.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>From those humble beginnings, WAFAD GROUP has steadily evolved into a respected force in Ghana’s agricultural sector. The company’s integrated operations continue to develop and expand with the unwavering commitment of its dedicated team.</p>
            
            <p>Today, WAFAD manages a growing network of:</p>
            <ul class="network-list">
                <li><b>1. BREEDER FARMS</b></li> 
                <li><b>2. MORDERN HATCHERY</b></li>
                <li><b>3. FEED MILL</b></li>
                <li><b>4. AGRIBUSINESS AND INNOVATION CENTER</b></li>
                <li><b>5. VETS, LABORATORIES AND CENTRAL SHOWROOM</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In 2019, WAFAD introduced dual-purpose poultry breeds to the Ghanaian market—birds that provide both meat and eggs. This innovation unlocked new opportunities for rural farmers and catalyzed the creation of CHICKEN4U, WAFAD’s flagship farmer empowerment model.</p>
            
            <p>CHICKEN4U is not just a product line. It is a rural transformation platform that supports women and youth in underserved communities with high-quality chicks, starter input kits, hands-on training, technical assistance, and guaranteed market access. Through the development of decentralized mother units, access to teen birds, and strengthened rural market systems, the model creates livelihoods, enhances household nutrition, and stimulates local economies.</p>
            
            <p>WAFAD’s approach is built on practical innovation, strategic execution, and a deep commitment to inclusive agricultural growth. At its core is the belief that sustainable national development begins with thriving smallholder farmers.</p>
            
            <p>Today, WAFAD GROUP continues to scale its operations and impact, leveraging strategic partnerships, local expertise, and a passionate workforce. With its eyes set on becoming a regional leader in integrated poultry production, the company remains grounded in its founding mission: to empower farmers, elevate rural communities, and build a stronger, more resilient agricultural future for Ghana and beyond.</p>

                <p>The <strong>CHICKEN4U</strong> Project is a strategic initiative developed in response to the growing demand for live, locally raised chicken in Ghana. It is designed to build a scalable and inclusive poultry model that centers around smallholder farmers, with the goal of improving rural livelihoods and strengthening the local food system.</p>
                <p>This pilot project focuses on professionalizing smallholder poultry ventures by equipping farmers with the tools, knowledge, and support systems necessary for long-term success. <strong>CHICKEN4U</strong> provides access to affordable and high-quality production inputs, including day-old chicks, feed, field vaccines, hygiene and health products, and ongoing technical support. Farmers are also trained in modern poultry husbandry and farm management techniques to improve productivity and profitability.</p>
                <p>A core component of the project is the introduction of <strong>‘GRANGER’</strong> improved dual-purpose poultry breeds, capable of delivering both eggs and meat to meet market demands. These birds are supported by quality nutrition and biosecurity protocols to ensure optimal performance under local conditions across the sub-Saharan countries.</p>

            <div class="model-description">
                <p>After selection and once all requirements are met, including adequate working capital, Mother Unit Operators (MUOs) receive training from the CHICKEN4U experts to prepare for operations. MUOs will place their chick orders through our Sales and Technical Officers (SATO), and each order is confirmed after full payment is received via our bank account or mobile money merchant account. The delivery date and pickup location for the day-old chicks are then scheduled in advance. MUOs brood the GRANGER chicks for approximately 28–35 days, providing them with proper heat, feed, and care to ensure healthy growth.</p>
                <p>After this brooding period, the MUOs sell their GRANGER “teen” chicks (4–5 weeks old) to local smallholder farmers, who will then raise the birds to maturity in backyards, free-range systems, or small poultry farms. This cycle of production and distribution ensures a continuous supply of poultry while allowing MUOs to restock their units regularly and maintain a sustainable business model.</p>
